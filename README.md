This package provides the essential building blocks for constitutive hyperelastic material formulations. This includes material behaviour-independent spaces and frameworks as well as material behaviour-dependent model formulations.

**Spaces** are full or partial deformations on which a given material formulation should be projected to, e.g. to the distortional (part of the deformation) space. Generalized *Total-Lagrange* **Frameworks** for isotropic hyperelastic material formulations based on the invariants of the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor and the principal stretches enable a clean coding of isotropic material formulations.

The math-module provides helpers in reduced vector ([Voigt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voigt_notation)) storage for symmetric three-dimensional second-order tensors along with a matrix storage for (at least minor) symmetric three-dimensional fourth-order tensors. Shear terms are not doubled for strain-like tensors, instead all math operations take care of the reduced vector storage.

$$ \boldsymbol{C} = \begin{bmatrix} C_{11} & C_{22} & C_{33} & C_{12} & C_{23} & C_{13} \end{bmatrix}^T $$

# Installation
Install Python, fire up 🔥 a terminal and run 🏃

```shell
pip install hyperelastic
```

# Usage
Material model formulations have to be created as classes with methods for the evaluation of the `gradient` (stress) and the `hessian` (elasticity) of the strain energy function. It depends on the framework which derivatives have to be defined, e.g. the derivatives w.r.t. the invariants of the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor or w.r.t. the principal stretches. An instance of a **Framework** has to be *finalized* by the application on a **Space**.

- [Distortional Space](https://github.com/adtzlr/hyperelastic/blob/main/src/hyperelastic/spaces/_distortional.py)
- [Dilatational Space](https://github.com/adtzlr/hyperelastic/blob/main/src/hyperelastic/spaces/_dilatational.py)

> ⓘ **Note**
> Define your own material model formulation with manual, automatic or symbolic differentiation with the help of your favourite package, e.g. [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [TensorTRAX](https://github.com/adtzlr/tensortrax), [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html), etc.

First, let's import hyperelastic (and its math module).

```python
import hyperelastic as hel
import hyperelastic.math as hm
```

## Invariant-based material formulations
A minimal template for an invariant-based material formulation applied on the distortional space:

```python
class MyInvariantsModel:
    def gradient(self, I1, I2, I3, statevars):
        """The gradient as the partial derivative of the strain energy function w.r.t.
        the invariants of the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor."""

        # user code
        dWdI1 = None
        dWdI2 = None
        dWdI3 = None

        return dWdI1, dWdI2, dWdI3, statevars

    def hessian(self, I1, I2, I3, statevars_old):
        """The hessian as the second partial derivatives of the strain energy function
        w.r.t. the invariants of the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor."""

        # user code
        d2WdI1I1 = None
        d2WdI2I2 = None
        d2WdI3I3 = None
        d2WdI1I2 = None
        d2WdI2I3 = None
        d2WdI1I3 = None

        return d2WdI1I1, d2WdI2I2, d2WdI3I3, d2WdI1I2, d2WdI2I3, d2WdI1I3


model = MyInvariantsModel()
framework = hel.frameworks.InvariantsFramework(model)
umat = hel.spaces.DistortionalSpace(framework)
```

### Available isotropic hyperelastic invariant-based material formulations
The typical polynomial-based material formulations ([Neo-Hooke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Hookean_solid), [Mooney-Rivlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooney%E2%80%93Rivlin_solid), [Yeoh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeoh_hyperelastic_model) are all available as submodels of the third order deformation material formulation.

## Principal stretch-based material formulations
A minimal template for a principal stretch-based material formulation applied on the distortional space:

```python
class MyStretchesModel:
    def gradient(self, λ, statevars):
        """The gradient as the partial derivative of the strain energy function w.r.t.
        the principal stretches."""

        # user code
        dWdλ1, dWdλ2, dWdλ3 = 0 * λ

        return [dWdλ1, dWdλ2, dWdλ3], statevars

    def hessian(self, λ, statevars_old):
        """The hessian as the second partial derivatives of the strain energy function
        w.r.t. the principal stretches."""

        # user code
        d2Wdλ1dλ1 = None
        d2Wdλ2dλ2 = None
        d2Wdλ3dλ3 = None
        d2Wdλ1dλ2 = None
        d2Wdλ2dλ3 = None
        d2Wdλ1dλ3 = None

        return d2Wdλ1dλ1, d2Wdλ2dλ2, d2Wdλ3dλ3, d2Wdλ1dλ2, d2Wdλ2dλ3, d2Wdλ1dλ3


model = MyStretchesModel()
framework = hel.frameworks.StretchesFramework(model)
umat = hel.spaces.DistortionalSpace(framework)
```

## Lab
By using [matadi](https://github.com/adtzlr/matadi)'s `LabIncompressible`, numeric experiments on homogeneous incompressible loadcases on hyperelastic material formulations are performed. Ensure to have [matadi](https://github.com/adtzlr/matadi) installed - run `pip install matadi` in your terminal.

```python
mooney_rivlin = hel.models.invariants.ThirdOrderDeformation(C10=0.3, C01=0.2)
framework = hel.frameworks.InvariantsFramework(mooney_rivlin)
umat = hel.spaces.DistortionalSpace(framework)

import matadi

lab = matadi.LabIncompressible(umat, title="Mooney Rivlin")
data = lab.run(
    ux=True,
    bx=True,
    ps=True,
    stretch_min=0.7,
    stretch_max=2.5,
)
fig, ax = lab.plot(data, stability=True)
```
